# STM32Blinky #

Some simple STM32 ARM test programs to verify toolchain, programmer and chip.

The programs are in C and may be compiled with GCC on Linux.

## Chips Supported ##

At present, there's only support for the STM32L103 on the "Blue Pill" development board.

## ARM Toolchain ##

A recent version of GCC for ARM, such as that installed by the Arduino "stm32duino" toolchain.

You'll also need some files from the ST "STM32CubeF1" repo on GitHub, such as the linker script.
